# Workshop overview


- This is an intense workshop on crafting packets using Python and Scapy
- We’ll understand low level networking details/abstractions like raw sockets and move towards using high level tools like Scapy to craft packets
- We’ll understand Scapy framework and craft packets using it
- We’ll leverage Scapy as a framework to build custom network tools/utilities

## Concepts covered

- Practical network reconnaissance techniques like host discovery, service discovery, Remote OS finger printing, promiscuous node detection using Scapy
- Launching Layer 2 attacks
- Leverage Scapy to build custom tools/utilities such as sniffers, pcap analyzer, wireless sniffers and scanners

## Skill prerequisites

- Basics of Python programming. (strings, lists, functions, list comprehensions etc)
- Knowledge of basic networking concepts. (Enough to know what an IP address, port number, OSI model etc.)
- Comfortable with basic operations on your host Operating System. (copying files, using text editor)

## Technical prerequisites

- Laptop with administrator access (mandatory)
- Minimum 4 GB RAM and 5 GB free hard disk space (More the better)
- Preferably running Linux as primary OS but Windows/Mac is permissible
- Preferably, your own Internet connectivity
